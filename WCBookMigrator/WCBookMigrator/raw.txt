    That awful Word, that sov'reign Power,
    <span>By whom the worlds were made,</span>
    (O happy morn! illustrious hour!)
    <span>Was once in flesh arrayed.</span>
    
    Then shone almighty power and love,
    <span>In all their glorious forms,</span>
    When Jesus left His throne above,
    <span>To dwell with sinful worms.</span>
    
    To dwell with misery below,
    <span>The Saviour left the skies,</span>
    And sunk to wretchedness and woe,
    <span>That worthless man might rise.</span>
    
    Adoring angels tune their songs,
    <span>To hail the joyful day;</span>

    The great Invisible! He dwells
    <span>Concealed in dazzling light;</span>
    But His all-searching eye reveals
    <span>The secrets of the night.</span>
    
    Those watchful eyes that never sleep,
    <span>Survey the world around;</span>
    His wisdom is a boundless deep,
    <span>Where all our thoughts are drowned.</span>

    Infinite years His life prolong,

    Firm as a rock His truth remains
    <span>To guard His promises.</span>
    
    Justice upon a dreadful throne

    Which His free love on us bestowed,

    <span>Assumed the human nature.</span>
    
    His parents poor in earthly store,
    <span>To enertain the Stranger</span>

    <span>Were seen by those that found Him,</span>

    <span>With swaddling bands around Him.</span>
    
    On the same night a glorious light

    Bright angels came in shining flame,

    <span>The glorious news to carry,</span>
    And in the stall they found them all,
    <span>Joseph, the Babe, and Mary.</span>

    Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
    <span>Unuttered or expressed,</span>
    The motion of a hidden fire
    <span>That trembles in the breast.</span>
    
    Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
    <span>The falling of a tear;</span>
    The upward glancing of an eye,
    <span>When none but God is near.</span>
    
    Prayer is the simplest form of speech
    <span>That infant lips can try;</span>
    Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach,
    <span>The majesty on high.</span>
    
    Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
    <span>The Christian's native air,</span>
    His watchword at the gate of death——
    <span>He enters heaven with prayer.</span>
    
    Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice
    <span>Returning from his ways,</span>
    While angels in their songs rejoice,
    <span>And say, "Behold, he prays!"</span>

<p class="songs">
    O Thou, in whose presence my soul takes delight,
    <span>On whom in affliction I call,</span>
    My comfort by day, and my song in the night,
    <span>My hope, my salvation, my all.</span>
    
    Where dost Thou at noontide resort with Thy sheep,
    <span>To feed on the pastures of love?</span>
    For why in the valley of death should I weep?
    <span>Alone in the wilderness rove!</span>
    
    O! why should I wander an alien from Thee,
    <span>And cry in the desert for bread?</span>
    My foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see,
    <span>And smile at the tears I have shed.</span>
    
    Ye daughters of Zion, declare, have you seen
    <span>The star that on Israel shone?</span>
    Say, if in your tents my Beloved has been,
    <span>And where with His flock He has gone?</span>
    
    This is my Beloved; His form is divine;
    <span>His vestments shed odors around;</span>
    The locks on His head are as grapes on the vine
    <span>When autumn with plenty is crowned.</span>
    
    The roses of Sharon, the lilies that grow
    <span>In vales, on the banks of the stream,</span>
    His cheeks in the beauty of excellence glow,
    <span>His eyes all invitingly beam.</span>
    
    His voice as the sound of a dulcimer sweet,
    <span>Is heard through the shadows of death;</span>
    The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,
    <span>The air is perfumed with His breath;</span>
    
    His lips as a fountain of righteousnesss, flow,
    <span>That waters the garden of grace,</span>
    From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
    <span>And bask in the smiles of His face.</span>
    
    Love sits in His eyelids, and scatters delight
    <span>Through all the bright mansions on high;</span>
    Their faces the cherubim vail in His sight,
    <span>And tremble with fullness of joy.</span>
    
    He looks, and ten thousand of angels rejoice,
    <span>And myriads wait for His word;</span>
    He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,
    <span>Re-echoes the praise of her Lord.</span>
    
    His vestment of righteousness who shall describe?
    <span>Its purity words would defile;</span>
    The heav'ns from His presence fresh beauties imbibe,
    <span>And earth is made rich by His smile.</span>
    
    Such is my Beloved, in excellence bright,
    <span>When pleased, He looks down from above</span>
    (Like the morn when it breathes from the chambers of light),
    <span>And comforts His people with love.</span>

<p class="songs">
    To show how humble Christians ought
    <span>To one another be,</span>
    Christ with His own example taught,
    <span>As plainly we may see.</span>
    
    Though He was Lord and Master great,
    <span>Who giveth all commands,</span>
    He washed His own disciples' feet,
    <span>With His own blessed hands.</span>
    
    When thus their Master with them dealt,
    <span>And proved His love to them,</span>
    How must their drooping hearts have felt,
    <span>To meet with such esteem!</span>
    
    May they who worldy honor seek,
    <span>Learn what it is to be</span>
    Like Jesus, humble, truly meek,
    <span>From self-applauses free.</span>
    
    Such facts as these should have effect,
    <span>To bring the haughty low;</span>
    The proudest heart should feel a check,
    <span>And deeply humbled, too.</span>
    
    Thus Peter's mind was much impressed,
    <span>He thought himself too mean;</span>
    But also felt himself distressed,
    <span>To have no part with Him.</span>
    
    "Till thou art washed, thou hast no part
    <span>With me," the Saviour said;</span>
    The Peter cried, "With all my heart!
    <span>Wash thou my hands and head."</span>

    There the Lord's Supper was prepared,
    <span>And Christ the Lord had with them shared,</span>
    Of which th' apostles did partake:
    <span>He thus an ordinance did make.</span>
    
    He rose and laid His garments by,
    <span>When towl and water were brought nigh;</span>
    To prove His love divinely sweet,
    <span>Proceeds to wash His servants' feet.</span>
    
    So after He had washed the feet,
    <span>resumed His garments, took His seat;</span>
    So we should love and kindness show,
    <span>To all our brethren here below.</span>
    
    "Ye call me Master and your Lord,
    <span>Which is according fto my Word;</span>
    If I have done this unto you,

    For in that night He was betrayed,
    <span>He for us all a pattern laid;</span>
    So let our works and virtues shine
    <span>To prove His patterns all divine.</span>
    
    The Lord who made the earth and sky,
    <span>Arose and laid His garments by,</span>
    And washed their feet to show that we
    <span>Should always kind and humble be.</span>
    
    He washed them all to make them clean,
    <span>But Judas still was full of sin;</span>
    May none of us, like Judas, sell,
    <span>The Lord for gold, and go to hell.</span>
    
    Peter said, "Lord, it shall not be,
    <span>Thou shalt not stoop to washing me;"</span>
    O that no christian here may say,
    <span>I'm too unworthy to obey.</span>
    
    "You call me Lord, and Master too,
    <span>Then do as I have done to you;</span>
    All my commands and counsels keep,
    <span>And show your love by washing feet.</span>

    When Joseph his brethren beheld,
    <span>Afflicted and trembling with fear,</span>
    His heart with compassion was filled,
    <span>From weeping he could not forbear;</span>
    A while his behavior was rough,
    <span>To bring their past sin to their mind;</span>
    But when they were humbled enough,
    <span>He hastened to show himself kind.</span>
    
    How little they thought it was he,
    <span>Whome they had ill-treated and sold!</span>
    How great their confusion must be,
    <span>As soon as his name he had told!</span>
    "I'm Joseph, your brother," he said,
    <span>"And still to my heart you are dear;</span>
    You sold me, and thought I was dead,
    <span>But God, for your sakes sent me here."</span>

    <span>When charged with purloining the cup;</span>

    "Can Joseph, whom we would have slain,
    <span>Forgive us the evil we did?</span>
    And will he our household maintain?

    Surrounded with terror and shame,
    <span>Unable to utter a word.</span>
    At first He looked stern and severe,
    <span>What anguish then pierced my heart,</span>
    Expecting each moment to hear
    <span>The sentence, "Thou cursed, depart!"</span>
    
    But O! what surprise when He spoke,
    <span>While tenderness beamed in His face,</span>
    My heart then to pieces was broke,
    <span>O'erwhelmed and confounded by grace.</span>
    "Poor sinner, I know thee full well;
    <span>By thee I was sold and was slain;</span>
    But died to redeem thee from hell,
    <span>And raise thee in glory to reign.</span>
    
    "I'm Jesus whom thou hast blasphemed,
    <span>And crucified often afresh;</span>
    But let me henceforth be esteemed,
    <span>Thy brother, thy bone, and thy flesh;</span>
    My pardon I freely bestow,
    <span>Thy wants will I fully supply;</span>
    I'll guide thee, and guard thee below,
    <span>And soon will remove thee on high.</span>
    
    "Go, publish to sinners around,
    <span>That they may be willing to come,</span>
    Thy mercy which now you have found,
    <span>And tell them that yet there is room."</span>
    O sinner! the message obey;

    This voice, transported, shall record
    <span>Thy goodness, tried so long;</span>
    Till, sinking slow, with calm decay,
    Its feeble murmurs melt away,
    <span>Into a seraph's song.</span>

<p class="songs Appendix">
    Ye men and angels! witness now,
    <span>Before the Lord we seek;</span>
    To Him we make our solemn vow,
    <span>A vow we dare not break.</span>
    
    That long as life itself shall last,
    <span>Ourselves to Christ we yield;</span>
    Nor from His cause will we depart,
    <span>Nor ever quit the field.</span>
    
    We trust not in our native strength,
    <span>But on His grace rely;</span>
    May He, with our returning wants,
    <span>A needful aid supply.</span>
    
    Oh! guide our doubtful feet aright,
    <span>And keep us in Thy ways;</span>
    And, while we turn our vows to pray'rs,
    <span>Turn Thou our prayers to praise.</span>

<h2 class="song A65" id="A65">Appendix 65<span>Meter 55.</span><span>[Holy Rest</span></h2>
<p class="songs Appendix">
    Abide with me! fast falls the eventide,
    <span>The darkness deepens, Lord, with be abide;</span>
    When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
    <span>Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.</span>
    
    Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
    <span>Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;</span>
    Change and decay in all around I see;
    <span>O Thou, who changest not, abide with me!</span>
    
    I need Thy presence every passing hour;
    <span>What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power!</span>
    Who like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
    <span>Through cloud and sunshine, Lord abide with me!</span>
    
    I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
    <span>Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.</span>
    Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?
    <span>I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.</span>
    
    Hold Thou the cross before my closing eyes;
    <span>Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:</span>
    Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee,
    <span>In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!</span>
